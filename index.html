<!-- To use React, you need npm which is included with Node.js. So you need npm and Node.js installed -->
<!-- To check if you have node.js, open up a terminal and type node --version. If you have something printed then you have node already. -->
<!-- If you don't have it, you have to download and install it.-->

<!-- Run this command to create a React application named my-react-app:
npx create-react-app my-react-app

The create-react-app will set up everything you need to run a React application. -->

<!-- Run the React Application

Now you are ready to run your first real React application!

Run this command to move to the my-react-app directory:
cd my-react-app

Run this command to run the React application my-react-app:
npm start

A new browser window will pop up with your newly created React App! If not, open your browser and type localhost:3000 in the address bar. -->
